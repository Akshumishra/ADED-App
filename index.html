            <h3>Encryption Decryption App</h3><a href="ED.html">
            <p>a secure communication tool that allows users to encrypt messages with a unique passkey, ensuring only those with the correct key can decrypt and read the content. It offers end-to-end encryption, meaning messages are encrypted on the senderâ€™s device and can only be decrypted by the recipient with the right passkey, enhancing privacy. For added security, the app does not store any passkeys, making it ideal for private conversations. Whether used for personal or professional communication, the app ensures that sensitive information remains protected from unauthorized access.</p>

            <h3>Image Encryption Decryption</h3><a href="templates/index1.html">
            <p>Image encryption with a hidden message combines encryption and steganography to securely embed a secret message within an image. The image, along with the concealed message, is encrypted using a password, making both unreadable without the correct key. When the correct password is provided, the image is decrypted, and the hidden message can be retrieved. This method ensures secure communication by protecting both the image and the message, making it ideal for private exchanges or confidential data hiding.</p>
